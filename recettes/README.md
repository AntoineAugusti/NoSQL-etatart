## Editing the front-end
If you want to edit JS files and Compass files, you will need to install [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/), [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and some node.js packages. You can install them by running the following commands from the root directory:
```bash
# Install Gulp globally
$ sudo npm install -g gulp
# Grap required packages
$ npm install
```

And then take advantage of the Gulpfile:
```bash
$ gulp
```
